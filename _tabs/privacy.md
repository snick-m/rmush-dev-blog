# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: February 2025

At Mushfiqur Rahman's Dev Blog, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you visit our website. By using this site, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

We respect your privacy and collect minimal data to understand how our site is used. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII).

### 1.1 Web Analytics
We use **GoatCounter** and **Cloudflare Web Analytics** to monitor and analyze web traffic. These services help us understand how visitors interact with our content without collecting any personal data.

- **GoatCounter**: Collects non-personally identifiable information, such as the number of visits, referring websites, and general geographic location based on IP addresses (anonymized). It does not use cookies and complies with GDPR.
- **Cloudflare Web Analytics**: Provides insights into website performance, including page views, referrer information, and general traffic data. It does not track individual users and avoids the use of cookies.

### 1.2 Cookies
We do not use cookies for tracking purposes on our website. Neither **GoatCounter** nor **Cloudflare Web Analytics** uses cookies to collect personal data, and there is no need for cookie consent.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

The data collected through **GoatCounter** and **Cloudflare Web Analytics** is used solely for:

- Understanding site traffic and visitor engagement.
- Improving the content and performance of the website.
- Identifying trends in how users interact with the content.

We do not share, sell, or rent your data to any third parties.

## 3. Data Retention

The data collected by **GoatCounter** and **Cloudflare Web Analytics** is retained for a limited time and is anonymized. We do not store personal information, and no identifying data is stored beyond what is necessary for basic analytics.

## 4. Your Rights and Choices

As a visitor to our site, you have the right to:

- **Opt-out of tracking**: Since our analytics tools do not track PII, there is minimal data collection. However, if you prefer, you can disable tracking entirely by using tools like browser extensions that block tracking scripts.
- **Access Data**: You can request information about the data we collect, though the data is anonymized and does not include any personal information.

## 5. Data Security

We take reasonable precautions to protect the data collected through web analytics. However, as with any online service, there are inherent risks involved in transmitting data over the internet, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

## 6. Third-Party Links

Our website may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third-party websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of every website you visit.

## 7. Compliance

We are committed to ensuring that your data is handled in compliance with applicable privacy laws:

- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: We do not collect personal data and respect the privacy of users in the European Union.
- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: We do not sell personal information, and we respect the privacy rights of California residents.
- **ePrivacy Directive (EU Cookie Law)**: No cookies are used on our website, so there is no need for cookie consent.
- **PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act)**: We ensure compliance with Canadian privacy laws by anonymizing all data collected.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. When we update the policy, we will post the new version on this page with the updated date. Please check back periodically for any changes.
